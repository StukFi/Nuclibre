 * The Evaluated Nuclear Structure Data File (ENSDF) is made up of a collection of
'data sets' which present one of the following kinds of information:
 <ul>
 <li>(1) The summary information for a mass chain giving information, e.g., evaluators'
names and aliations, cuto date, evaluators' remarks, and publication
details, etc.</li>
 </ul>
A Comments data set gives abstract information for the nuclide. This
data set contains summary information as described in (1) above. This data
set exists only if the nuclide was evaluated or updated beyond the whole
mass chain was evaluated.
